# AboutMe
I am a detail-oriented, empathetic person with a passion for _clean code_. I am analytical, critical, quick to learn, and creative when it comes to proposing solutions. I also act as a facilitator in processes.  
I aim to continue improving my skills and learning from more experienced professionals, with the goal of one day taking on a technical leadership role. I am particularly interested in the Javascript and Typescript _stack_, especially frameworks like React, Angular, and NestJS.
